CS3216 Dafuq?!
==

Hi everyone, I'm Chunmun. Being relatively a fresh face in web application development, the decision to take up CS3216 has not been a simple one. Those who actually knowingly invite pain and sleepless nights must have been living too good a life.

One point that did convince me a lot, practically, is the other choices that were available, aka other Software Engineering modules were simply more horrifying. It is the people that we are surrounded with, that really sets this module apart from the rest. Not about the exclusiveness or perks but about the like-minded drive, that provided the most draw for me. It is an amazing opportunity to find a pack of masochists all in one place. It is hard not to get excited and put all your chips on this module - I am aware this will probably be a show-hand in time and energies this semester. And the best part is most of them are not going to fold and follow the bet.

Do whatever you want (within moral constraints)

Come on, how many modules come with the vaguest set of rules and still manage to be not annoying. There so much leg-room here, I at a totally lost of what to do. It also means I'll probably only learn as much as I want. Got no time to learn NodeJS, perfect, now it's a module-requirement and you're going to be rewarded for it. Want to know how to talk to a client, there's a live one standing there now. Like every good game, the rules are simple but difficult to master. It will be totally up to one's efforts. There do not exist much opportunities where you can get 10X the rewards if you put in 10X the effort. Now you mix this up with the zaniest people and it's the makings of one scary movie where I cannot predict the ending to.

In conclusion, I'm tired of being mediocre. It's time to rock the boat and seize the day.
