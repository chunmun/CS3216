Building everything and nothing
===

Now that forces me to think long and hard. Recently I made a joke with my friends about IVLE showing a lot of nothing. How it is possible someone spent so much time making something that does almost nothing. That is exactly what I'm afraid of.

I believe whatever that I do end up building, makes a difference to someone's life out there. Whether it causes a ton of heartache (and subsequently, births another self-taught hacker) or joy - it should impact them. Maybe it doesn't have to be a very big group of people, but there should be someone that cares about it. It is so frighteningly easy to create something of non-value and feel like doing homework at the same time. Liken to a silent fart, nobody likes it and I'm too embarrassed to admit that I did it.

Guiding principles like building around a problem helps to absolve some of these problems. So we just need to find problems right :) There's so much problems in this world, and many people are invested in their solutions. Turns out it's not that simple. Already my teammates tells me a problem I have no idea how to solve, on the first day we met.

Found a problem, now comes the hard part, we going to try our hand at solving it and there's no textbook on this to boot. The main problem I see with this is that most programmers are not humans. Not normal humans in the sense their skills at navigating the web landscape is so good, there are lots of basic assumptions of ability. I've worked on the CVWO with Prof Ben over the summer and have been deeply reminded of that fact everytime we visit our users. How in the world are we going to solve a problem for a group of people which don't know how they are going to use?

No answers are forthcoming, and I think I'll have make this up as we go along
