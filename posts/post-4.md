Team Dynamics
==

No man is an island entire of itself
Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main
If a clod be washed away by the sea
Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were
As well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were
Any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls
it tolls for thee. 

~ John Donne

Ok I only googled the first sentence, but the interpretation is surprisingly apt.

### How much control and authority would you have given to this fourth voice in our choice of platform (HTML5/native iOS)?

I would considered carefully whether this fourth voice has enough experience under his belt to make good of his opinions. Frankly, the 2 different platforms are both an equally untamed land to me. It's going to be a learning trip no matter the outcome. If it is an assessment which is outside the scope of our own knowledge, it'll be futile to try so. Ever tried assessing what sort of illness you might be having from Google?

Why listen to only one voice? There's an internet of people just waiting to shove advice down your throat. Check out if anyone has tried doing the same. Have they succeeded? If not, why not. If so, how to do better? Very much in the same spirit of the pitching session, if it is a smart enough idea, someone would have tried it before. I would try aggregating a few sources, do some cross-referencing, check my sanity with some non-computing friends. There is absolutely no need to confine yourself to the control and authority of 1 fourth voice.

To be fair, not everyone is going to give good advice, neither may the majority. But there is going to be a good chance, if we ask the right questions, of finding out how not to fail. I believe most of human advice are learnt from failures, seriously how many people have enough serial successes to lay-down guidelines for them. More likely than not, we know what went wrong the last time, and try not to do it again. This brings a full circle back to the credibility of the fourth voice - What are his reasons for his choices, given his experience with the failures he grappled with.

Inexperience is no excuse for gullibility.

### With the deadline just 2 weeks away, how would you, as project manager, resolved this problem if it were to occur within the team?

There has always been a running joke among programmers giving time estimates. In case you haven't noticed, here's a nice conversion table for programmer speech:

Even before that, how much of the 2 weeks time are we talking about? 2 weeks before the finals? Then you have to re-adjust the REAL available time to 1 week. How many of the other students have deadline alarm bells going off in the same time? Take moar time out. It's the project manager's job to figure these parts out. Realistically, given those constraints, I would scream, cut out all the bells and whistles! Leave just one impressive function in, kill the rest of the stuff that doesn't support that function. They won't be missed if they can't be built.


### What are some of the issues that we presented that could have happened to any team? List down 3, and talk about how you would have resolved these issues.

#### 1 Coder horror

I can probably see this happening more often in Singapore than maybe the US. Look at the ratios NUS is taking in and churning out. We are pushing out more business graduates than computing ones. There's is going to be more managers than actual programmers. Of course this is gross generalization and there is probably no need for so many programmers given that at lot of the local companies still operate in the archaic age and organize most things around spreadsheets and word documents.

However, to build a serious app. A usable one that comes with a whole host of issues that need to be tackled on a daily basis - maintainence, scalability, stability, responsiveness, relevance. I recently had a client ask me a really interesting question.

Why does code need maintenance? Do they spoil?

I don't know, so much magic happens in the background to keep their little bubbly world running. Software is the beating heart powering a large part of the modern world - You don't notice your heart working nor take much care until it starts to break down.

1 good programmer = 10 normal ones, 1 normal programmer is infinity better than bad ones. Btw Google has thousands so you can get your search result back at you faster than you can blink. It's not normal behaviour! 

#### Jibaboom - The music of TNT in the backdrop of arguments

"I knew it will be hard, but I didn't expect it to be this difficult, this long and this painful" - Joke from a friend doing team projects. Why do we need to argue so long, there should be a cut-off time to make decision (lest we have the government shutdown). Arguments should be also be weighted against the benefits of not having it rather than just balanced on the outcome of their settlement. Sometimes a coin is more fair than democracy.

#### Let's do incredible stuff!
The first person to exclaim this probably is a lunatic or masochist. Everyone likes to play a good game, not everyone likes to make one. A great advice from my formerphysics teacher, if you want to do superhuman things, you need to put in superhuman effort. I call it the law of conservation of awesomeness. 

Unless you find yourself surrounded by like-minded freaks of nature, do not open this door. The decision to do something hard is much more difficult than the actual implementation - duh? The only thing worst than suffering, is probably suffering alone.
