Drop me a line app
===

The presentations turned out to be unexpectedly interesting (Even though of the apps may not be). I guess even SoC guys can put up a presentation or two :) Through the many laughs and yawns, we can see that the presentation style of 20 slides x 20 secs actually manages to cover a ton of material. I can't believe we completed 12 apps in one night. If only we can do 12 lectures in the same way too.

#### Naver Line

Seems like chatting apps are a dime a dozen these days - Whatsapp, WeChat, Momo and now Line. Many more chatting apps that I don't even know about. Most of them actually have a similar set of expected features like group messaging. However each comes with a distinctive taste and Line tastes like sushi.

The app, hailing from the land of the rising sun, comes with cutesy UI and features messaging and voice recording in its base app. Much of Line's uniqueness stem from it integration with a wide array of games. When I first discovered Line, I thought it was a game app more than a messaging app.

In fact, it's download size like 16+Mb - Gigantasaurous for a messaging app, double the size of Whatsapp. Maybe it's because Japan has an exceptional wireless internet infrastructure, the download size wouldn't have been such a big problem.


#### Many Faces - Be something to everybody
It tries to create many different experiences for the people who are already registered in the main app, similar in nature to Habbo Hotel and more. Line Pop, its most popular game, is actually just like Bejeweled. Much of its monetisation strategies comes from the in-app purchases that available in these games. There is hardly any ads in any of their products except the ones that promote from Naver themselves.

The cute images also trigger shudders down my spine and its not going to be acceptable to everyone.

However, their diverse universe of connections basically means that you'd never run out of things to do, or explore. Just download another one of their games/plugin to enjoy even more crap.

I believe that the strategy of developing more and more games within the company itself might not be a scalable plan. A more viable one would be to open their APIs for use by developers. There would be a danger of lousy apps (cue blackberry disaster music), but it's the next step if the app wants to innovate faster than it can with its own team.
